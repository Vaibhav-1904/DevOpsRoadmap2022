**Network** is a collection of computers, servers, mainframes, network devices, peripherals, or other devices connected to allow data sharing.

**Networking** is the practice of transporting and exchanging data between nodes over a shared medium in an information system.

There are four types of Networking:
- **LAN:** Local Area Network
- **WAN:** Wide Area Network
- **MAN:** Metropolitan Area Network
- **WAN:** Wide Area Network

**Switch** is a device that operates at the Data Link layer of the OSI modelâ€”Layer 2. <br/>
It takes in packets being sent by devices that are connected to its physical ports and sends them out again, but only through the ports that lead to the devices the packets are intended to reach. 

They can also operate at the network layer--Layer 3 where routing occurs.

**Routers** are networking devices operating at layer 3 or a network layer of the OSI model. <br/>
They are responsible for receiving, analysing, and forwarding data packets among the connected computer networks. <br/>
When a data packet arrives, the router inspects the destination address, consults its routing tables to decide the optimal route and then transfers the packet along this route.

**Features of Routers**
- A router is a layer 3 or network layer device.
- It connects different networks together and sends data packets from one network to another.
- A router can be used both in LANs (Local Area Networks) and WANs (Wide Area Networks).
- It transfers data in the form of IP packets. In order to transmit data, it uses IP address mentioned in the destination field of the IP packet.
- Routers have a routing table in it that is refreshed periodically according to the changes in the network. In order to transmit data packets, it consults the table and uses a routing protocol.

Routers are manufactured by some popular companies like Cisco, D-Link, HP etc.
