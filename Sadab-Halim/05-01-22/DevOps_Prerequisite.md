### VI Editor
VI Editor has two modes of operations: 
- Command Mode
- Insert Mode

When we open a file in VI Editor by default we are in **Command Mode**.
In the **Command Mode** we can issue commands to the editor such as to copy and paste lines, delete lines or to naviage between lines, etc. But we cannot write content to the file in Command Mode.

To write contents to the file we must switch to **Insert Mode**.

_To Switch to Insert Mode_, type `i`

Now, we can modify the modify the file content as per our wish.

_To switch back to Command Mode from Insert Mode_, press `Esc`
