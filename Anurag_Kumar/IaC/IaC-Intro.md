### What is infrastructure as Code?
IaC is basically managing your infrastructure(networks,VMs,load balancers etc.) using code. 

- The problem with traditional manual process was that people have to work to do the same things again and again such as spinning up a server, doing some configuration changes etc. It was really hard to keep the Audit trail of who have done what. 

### Benefits of IaC
- Automation (It's automatically done via the code and no human envolvement is required)
- Reusability of Code (You can use the code to spin up multiple servers and any infrastructure component)
- Version Control (You can figure out what was wrong with the previous infrastructure if something goes wrong)

### IaC tools (Open Source)
- Terraform (uses hashicorp configuration language)
- Crossplane (uses YAML primarily)
- Pulumi (use whatever language you are comfortable in)
