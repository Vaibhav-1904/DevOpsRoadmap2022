## OSI model (Open System Interconnection Model)
- OSI model is a layered model of computer networks.

### layers of OSI model
- physical layer
- link layer
- network layer
- transport layer
- session layer
- presentation layer
- application layer 

there is a another model called TCP/IP model.
a TCP/IP model is a layered model of computer networks.    

### layers of TCP/IP model

- data link layer
- network layer
- transport layer
- application layer
