### `chmod`

This commands is used to change file or directory permission.

There are two do ways to change a file permission:
- symbolic mode
- absolute mode

Types of permission a file have :
- [`u`]Owner permissions: The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.
- [`g`]Group permissions: The group's permissions determine what actions a user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.
- [`o`]Other (world) permissions: The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file.

| Chmod Operator | Description | 
| -------- | -------- |

|  `-` |  Removes the designated permission(s) from a file or directory. |

$ touch text

# to see what permission does the file have
$ ls -l text 
-rwxrwxrwx 1 mavrick mavrick 0 Jan 23 17:51 text

# to remove excute permission from Owner 
$ chmod u-x text

$ ls -l text
-rw-rwxrwx 1 mavrick mavrick 0 Jan 23 18:02 text

```

#### Absolute mode

```shell
chmod 777 text
# gives all the permission to `text` file
# u = 7 (rwx)
# g = 7 (rwx)
# o = 7 (rwx)

chmod 742 text
# gives all the permission to `text` file
# u = 7 (rwx)
# g = 4 (r--)
# o = 2 (-w-)
```
